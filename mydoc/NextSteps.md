### Next Steps

This is to log my random thoughts on future steps...

#### Oct 29th

Three directions we can go (interest level goes along with appearance order):

- Linalg/Loop to equeue dialect
  - Make specific compiler that targets systolic array first and then...
  - We might be able to come up with user annotations

- Generate fast simulation
  - Comparing among different dataflow doesn't work
  - But inside the same dataflow, we can try different buffer size 
    - if the allocation is valid
    - which allocation works best

- Verification
  - Functional correctness check

Some thoughts/confusions on high level abstraction

- Modify simulator

  - *ModelOp()* determines the whole execution time all at once? 
    - No aliasing for input argument, might want to add it
  - What if generic inside generic? But I don't see any example so that's also an issue that I don't know how to do generic inside generic (might not work since generic is simply designed for linear algebra). 
    - We therefore might need generic to generic pass  e.g. lowering from 3d convolution to 2d convolution.

- Whether to include hardware details in linalg dialect

  - That also affect modeling execution time (parallel/sequential).

    - Need to create new operations. 

    - ```mlir
      %generic_ssa = generic(...){...} : (...) -> memref<...>
      equeue.apply(%hardware, %generic_ssa) 
      ```

    -  Or modify doc in linalg.generic [attributes](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Dialects/Linalg/#attributes-3)?

  - Even with hardware information (we might need new dialect), it is still hard to imagine how to model systolic array at high level. We might need to say something like "this generic region is applied on a systolic array of with balabala size". 

    - One concern on this is will the lowering be very specific? e.g. a compiler pass is only usable for matching a specific systolic array with specific dataflow. Maybe it can be left to hardware designer to implement this? 

- Lowering from linalg to loops requires modification on signals

  - May lower to loops (with existing passes e.g. [-convert-linalg-to-affine-loops](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Passes/#-convert-linalg-to-affine-loops-lower-the-operations-from-the-linalg-dialect-into-affine-loops), [-convert-linalg-to-loops](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Passes/#-convert-linalg-to-loops-lower-the-operations-from-the-linalg-dialect-into-loops) etc). Then add a pass to add signals at each loop.
  - One problem is I am not sure how to determine parallel loop and sequential loop during lowering. 
    - Simple heuristic lowering requires huge amount of analysis. The lowering itself forms a problem.
    - Maybe a simple hardcoded lowering pass first? (As a case study?) 
    - Does it hurt the generality of the lowering? Ideally, even with a simple lowering, we want it to be general and effective, i.e. does some analysis and result won't be very bad compared to human optimized results.

- High level abstraction is a nice property but hard to model
  - Again, what's the selling point? 
  - How to experimentally prove the selling point?

- **Container Recomposition Issue**

  Image we have a [5x1] container, and we want to remove the first value and append a new value to the tensor pointed by the container. We want these operations to be **free**. How shall we create operations?

  - The most straight forward way is to add `equeue.split` and`equeue.concate`

    ```MLIR
    container<5x1xf32, i32> a
    b=split(a, [0, 4], [0, 1]) -> container<5x1xf32, i32> 
    c=split(a, [4, 5], [0, 1]) -> container<1x1xf32, i32> 
    container<1x1xf32, i32> on_other_memory
    memcpy(on_other_memory, c)
    a = concate(b, c, dim=1) -> container<5x1xf32, i32> 
    ```

    However, this way of implementation will cause two problems:

    1. Previously, only `equeue.alloc` can create `container` , and `equeue.dealloc` to delete `container`. The won't be overlaps and assigning memory is simple (by checking *memory size - allocated memory size < size to allocate* )

       Now, with split and concatenation, things becomes complicated. Two container can point to the same memory or overlapping memories.

    2. Also, the `split` and `concate` operations shouldn't be inside `equeue` dialect.

  -  To avoid (1), we may create a `view` type and each container is only assigned once. But then `view` can also have the same issue about view overlapping...

  - To avoid (2), we may want to create a special read and write for `container` type, which is free (doesn't cost energy, latency etc)

    ```MLIR
    container<5x1xf32, i32> a
    tensor_a = free_read(a)->tensor<5x1xf32>
    tensor_b, tensor_c = split(tensor_a, ...) -> tensor<4x1xf32>, tensor<4x1xf32>
    
    // Where to write it back??
    free_write(tensor_b, tensor_c, a)
    // maybe b = free_write(tensor_b) 
    // if free_write can create new tensor, where is the memory (i32) info??
    
    container<1x1xf32, i32> on_other_memory
    memcpy(on_other_memory, a)
    //How to know which part of memory to write?
    
    ```

- Fix simulator on get_comp and write the new large example
- Try verify results of simulation with
  - Verilog/HLS
  - Scale-sim
  - my knowledge



#### Sep 3th

- Add network / BUS operation

- Front-end: https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Bindings/Python/
- Validate through SCale-Sim: https://github.com/ARM-software/SCALE-Sim or build Verilog (also affect how to build front-end)

#### Validation

- Implement architecture like systolic array and ML accelerator like Eyeriss at different scales. 

- Having two designs with relative accuracy can somewhat help validate the simulator.
  - take 2 result from literature (l1, l2)
  - write the designs in equeue dialect, and then run equeue simulator generate two results (e1,e2)
  - if the relative result in energy and latency (l1/l2, e1/e2) are the same or close, the simulator make sense

- Some obstacles in the above validation flow
  - It is hard to write equeue dialect example! Especially for larger hardware like Eyeriss. I've spent a week to make python version simulator work...
    - Need a high level generator...Not sure if it's the right way though
  - Parallelism, large scale operation is not handled in equeue dialect yet.
    - Build parallel semantics, or in high level generator create the component multiple times.
  - Network/BUS is not modeled yet.

#### BUS/Network

- equeue.create_bus bandwidth
  - bus should be there for all data transfer, so it's essentially a network connecting two level memories.
  - BUS is Network in Magnolia
    https://github.com/cucapra/Magnolia/tree/master/example

- implict BUS vs. explict BUS
  - implict: create connection at component creation time, not specify in control
  - explict: read (%data) through (%BUS)

- At simulation, BUS check bandwidth and timing to determine the transfer time.

#### Let's increase scalability!

- comp creation operations:
  - %1 = create_mem "my_name_is_mem", %0
  - %2 = create_comp (%1, ...)
  - get_comp(%2, "my_name_is_mem") 

- Duplications and get the duplications

  1. new type:  equeue.shape
     equeue.shape< 3x2x container<tensor<5xf32>, i32> >
     equeue.shape< 3x2x i32 >
     Prob is: how to realize?

  2. %outer = equeue.parallel () = () to () step (){
    ​     equeue.yield %inner
     }
     %outer should be equeue.shape type

  3. %comp = equeue.dup %component, [N, N]

     %comp should be equeue.shape type

  4. Scalability in data

     - Split and concatenate tensor => putting a partitioned tensor to a container
       But I don't see any support
       std only has element level extraction and concatenation[10xi32]

     - So maybe splitting container<tensor<2x5xf32>,i32> instead:
       equeue.split_container
       equeue.concate_container

#### Pipelining  

- In order execution, out of order write back
  - It's more rely on simulation model
  - Or, we can do it explictly
    equeue.pipeline{
    ​	opA 
    ​	opB
    ​	opC
    }
